Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.  

Installation:

`npm install`  

To Start Server:

`npm start`  

To Visit App:

## Reflection

I learned to use API using fetch method. The pagination implemented is dynamic in nature, which means if size of components is reduced pagination adjusts automatically.

The technologies implemented in this project are React and TailwindCSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
